Direct Contact:
Contractors were contacted via phone to verify data including annual turnover, number of employees, and specialities.

Data Entry and Cleaning:
Data was compiled into a spreadsheet (data/raw/contractor_data.csv), cleaned using pandas, and standardized for analysis.

Validation:
Cross-verification was performed to ensure consistency in contact information, ratings, and turnover data.

Would you like me to create a sample CSV file (contractor_data.csv) with 10–15 realistic dummy entries based on this structure?
You could then directly place it inside your data/raw/ folder for your GitHub repository.

You said:
is it requirements.txt or requirements.text
ChatGPT said:

Good question — it should always be named:

✅ requirements.txt

Not ❌ requirements.text or any other variation.

Here’s why:

.txt is the correct file extension recognized by Python tools.

When you run commands like:

pip install -r requirements.txt


pip specifically looks for a file named requirements.txt.

If you name it requirements.text, Python and pip will not recognize it automatically, and you’ll get an error like:

ERROR: Could not open requirements file: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'requirements.text'


✅ Correct: requirements.txt
❌ Incorrect: requirements.text, requirement.txt, or requirementsfile.txt

Would you like me to show how to include this file in your GitHub project folder structure properly (with setup instructions)?
